EP-Sleepy 

EPSleepy is the code made for a prototype for my FMP. 

The .h files are the setup files, showing the steps the code takes. Think of it as a rough sketch of the final arduino code. 




Code in the repository
The Testing code 
there are different arduino programs in this repository. EP-SLeepy is the main code with all the different components. 
When setting up the system, it is good to test each part seperately. For this purpose, there are a set of Testing codes for the buttons, lights audioplayer and SD drive. Use these to test the parts of the system seperately and get a feel for the different parts of the full code.
